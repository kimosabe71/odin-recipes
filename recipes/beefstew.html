        <p>
            Beef stew is a hearty dish that I find easy to make for meal prepping.
            Its full of heart pieces of beef and veggies that make it the perfect 
            one bowl meal needed to fuel my day.

        <p>
            I prefer using cuts of steak(leaner) as my choice of meat, but feel 
            free to use chuck or any other cut of beef. Also prefer using small 
            golden potatoes as they have a much creamier texture than russets. 
            I make my beef stew in the instant pot as it is a set it and forget it
            process. You throw all your ingredients in the pot and you are all set!
