        <h2>A Puerto Rican comfort dish</h2>

        <p>
            Mofongo is a dish that is made using green 
            plantains and is a common dish in Puerto 
            Rican cuisine. It was never made often in 
            my house, but when it was it never lasted.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mofongo is made from fried green plantains 
            that is the mashed together with a garlic
            paste and bits of crispy pork, usually served 
            in a pilon, a wooden mortar. Now there
            are many different ways to make mofongo 
            and I prefer my mofongo to be made with a 
            sauce that can be poured over the mashed plantains.

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat about 2 inches of oil over 
                medium-high heat in a large skillet 
                or deep fryer to 350
            </li>
            <li>
                While the oil is heating up, peel
                the plantains and cut into 1-inch rounds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fry the plantains until golden and 
                tender, 4 to 6 min.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove cooked plantains from the pan
                or fryer to a paper towel lined plate
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the garlic paste in a large bowl 
                or mortar and add the garlic plantains,
                in batches, if necessary. Mash thoroughly.
